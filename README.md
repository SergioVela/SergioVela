Hi, I’m @sergioVela

🌱 I’m interested in web development, AI, and building efficient and scalable software solutions.
    
📚 I’m currently learning Docker and Kubernetes to enhance my DevOps skills.
   My expertise lies in developing native Android apps. I leverage Angular for the frontend, TypeScript for efficient development, Spring Boot for backend services, and Java for overall application logic. I'm proficient in implementing continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines using AWS CodeBuild, ensuring efficient and reliable software releases.

🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to Angular, Spring Boot, and cloud technologies.
